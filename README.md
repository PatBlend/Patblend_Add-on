At the time of this writing, the four add-ons that make up this are <b>Render Setup</b>, <b>Unit Converter</b>, <b>Coder-Decoder</b> and <b>Quick Search</b>.

<h1>Description</h1>

<b>Render Setup:</b>
This add-on has a user friendly interface. It quickly sets up the render engine of your choice. There are simple settings such as Samples, Output size, FPS, and World Color that helps an artist focus on what matters.

<b>Unit Manipulator:</b>
A quick way to convert between different units. This add-on can convert Length and Time, and even give a brief description of each unit.

<b>Quick Search:</b>
Need to search for a reference image or a texture, but only have one monitor? Quick Search helps with that. All you need to do is type in an URL or a keyword and press Search. Blender will automatically decide if you entered an URL or a keyword and open your default browser to provide you with answers.

<b>Coder-Decoder:</b>
If you need to send a secret message, you can code it with the PatBlend Coder-Decoder. People without this Add-on will be baffled! This add-on supports three codecs at the time of this writing, but more and even a custom codec are going to be added soon.
